# ldaca/formatter-date

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install formatter-date
```

# Usage

```bash
import { format } from "formatter-date";

let date = new Date();
let formattedDate = format(date);
console.log(formattedDate);
```
